Part A: Computing Research (60 points)
1.	Hardware vs. Software Analysis (20 points) 
o	Research and explain the difference between computer hardware and software
- The difference between computer hardware and software is that hardware includes the physical components to a computer, while software is the digital applications that run with the hardware, but also tell the hardware what to do.
o	Provide three examples of each with explanations
-	Hardware includes things like a Processor, which is like the Brain of the computer, a Graphics Card, which handles most of the load that the CPU brings with the creation of videos, photos and animations, and RAM which takes short term memory from the processor at high speeds.  Software includes things like a computers OS (Mac/Windows/Linux), which is the main component to a working computer to allow other software to load. Drivers, which allow specific hardware like GPUs, and some keyboards and mice to work better. Also, Google Chrome, which is a popular browser for the internet.
o	Describe how they work together in a computer system
-	Hardware and software work together in a system by helping each other to run smoothly, for example with drivers, hardware depends on the drivers to help those components perform correctly. 
2.	Programming Language Investigation (20 points) 
o	Research three different programming languages
-	Python, JavaScript, and HTML
o	Compare their uses, strengths, and typical applications
-	Python’s strengths include its simple syntax, versatility for applications, and prebuilt libraries, some typical applications are web development, AI, and game development. JavaScript’s strengths include its versatility, active community, and ease of learning, like python, its uses include web and game development, along with other things. HTML’s strengths are the ease of learning, SEO friendliness, and strong community resources, its typical uses are web applications, website development, as well as game development. 
o	Explain why Python is good for beginners
-	Python is good for beginners because of its Readability, Simplicity, Extensibility, and Portability. It allows for easy use and learnability for beginners to begin understanding a coding language. 
3.	Career Exploration (20 points) 
o	Research three computing career paths
-	Security Architect, Cybersecurity Legal Advisor, Digital Forensics analyst

o	Describe required skills and typical responsibilities
-	Security Architect- Skills include strong cloud security, cryptography, and network security skills. Responsibilities include designing and implementing security architecture, assessing risks, and testing security measures. 

-	Cybersecurity Legal Advisor- Skills include strong analytical, communication, and technological skills. Responsibilities include Legal advisory for data protection with cybercrime, incident response to data breaches, and risk management for organizations. 

-	Digital Forensics Analyst- Skills include strong analytical and problem solving skills, as well as expertise in specialized forensic tools. Responsibilities include collecting and preserving digital evidence, analyzing the evidence, documenting those findings and recovering encrypted files. 

o	Explain how programming fits into each career
-	Security Architect- It allows them to analyze code to see deeper vulnerabilities within a system. Therefore, giving them stronger security.
-	Cybersecurity Legal Advisor- It allows them to understand technical details that they are advising and advise companies based on that knowledge, as well as allowing them to respond to data breaches.
-	Digital Forensics Analyst- It allows them to automate repetitive tasks, reverse engineer certain cases, and data extraction.

Part B: Python Environment (40 points)
1.	Installation Documentation (15 points) 
o	Install Python on your personal computer (if available)
Done
o	Document the installation process with screenshots
o	Test installation with basic commands
Done
 
2.	VSCode Exploration (15 points) 
o	Explore VScode menu options and features
Done
o	Create 1-page guide for new users

After downloading VS Code, you will be met with a simple home page. To create a file, select "File" and then "New File". From here, you can begin typing your code. If you would like to open a project of mutiple files, simply select "Open Folder". This will allow you to open multiple files at once and send them in a folder together. These files can be seen and edited seperately under the explorer on the left side of the screen. 
One thing that is a necessity for programmers in the application is plugins. This is neccessary for many different things, you can download from the extensions tab within the application and easily download things like Python, customizable home screens, and other useful plugins.
o	Practice saving and running Python files
Done
3.	First Programs (10 points) 
o	Create three simple programs that display different information
Done
o	Use proper file naming conventions
Done
o	Include comments in all programs
Done
